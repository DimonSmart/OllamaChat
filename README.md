# OllamaChat

OllamaChat is an inspiring playground built on [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) that helps C# developers explore the breadth of modern AI.

## Features

- **Multi-agent Nova Chat** – orchestrate lively debates, like pitting famous philosophers against each other.
- **Single-agent Nova Chat** – keep it simple with one responsive assistant.
- **Document uploads** – give agents background files just like OpenAI does.
- **Flexible connections** – talk to local Ollama servers or remote OpenAI endpoints.

From playful battles to practical experiments, this repository shows how Semantic Kernel can bring creative conversations to life and serves as a great starting point for getting familiar with its capabilities.
